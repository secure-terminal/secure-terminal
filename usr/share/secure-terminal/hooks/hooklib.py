"""Shared configuration loading for the example command hooks.

The AI prompt and the allow/block/ask command rules are CONFIGURATION, not code:
they live in files under the secure-terminal drop-in directories, so an admin (or
a user, if allowed) can edit them without touching the shipped handler. Files are
read in tier order, highest precedence last:

    /usr/lib/secure-terminal.d/<name>          built-in vendor default (lowest)
    /etc/secure-terminal.d/<name>              system administrator
    /usr/local/etc/secure-terminal.d/<name>    local administrator
    ~/.config/secure-terminal.d/<name>         user -- ONLY if an admin allows it

The user (home) tier is honored ONLY when a PRIVILEGED tier sets
`hook_config_allow_user=true` in hooks.conf (default no): the AI prompt and the
rules are security-relevant, so a user cannot weaken the judge unless the admin
opts in. The gate itself is read from the privileged tiers only, so home cannot
flip it. Self-contained (no secure_terminal import), so a hook stays copyable."""
