The secure-terminal widget.

Design (see https://secure-terminal.github.io):

- DISPLAY is printable-ASCII by default. Program output is passed through
  render_output(): ANSI/OSC escape sequences are removed and, in the default
  'strip' mode, every character that is not printable ASCII (plus tab and
  newline) becomes '_', the way sanitize-string/stcat neutralize a log. There is
  no escape parser, so a hostile filename, a forged status line or a Trojan-
  Source comment cannot redraw or reorder what you read. Two optional display
  modes trade some of that for readability, per tab: 'show' renders a non-ASCII
  character as its glyph when it is printable (str.isprintable() excludes the
  invisible, bidi and format characters that make unicode deceptive), so a log
  with legitimate unicode is readable while the dangerous classes still collapse
  to '_'; 'reveal' shows every non-ASCII character as a <U+XXXX> badge so you can
  inspect exactly what is there. Two cursor controls are honored, and both are
  necessary: the interactive shell echoes its line editing with backspace and
  carriage return (readline sends "\b \b" to rub out a character and redraw after
  tab-completion/history; zsh returns to column 0 with a carriage return to draw
  its prompt) regardless of the pty's echo flag, so a terminal that dropped them
  could not display line editing at all. Terminal overwrite semantics apply on
  the current line: backspace moves the cursor one cell left, a bare carriage
  return moves it to column 0, and a printable character overwrites the cell
  under the cursor (never inserting-and-shifting). "\r\n" is collapsed to "\n"
  first, since the pty maps every newline to CRLF and that carriage return is
  only a line ending. BOTH controls are bounded to the current line and can
  never reach an earlier line or the scrollback. The residual is that a program
  which prints its own backspaces or carriage returns can rewrite text WITHIN
  the line it is on (e.g. "bad\b\b\bok" shows "ok"); this is far narrower than
  cursor addressing and cannot touch already-committed lines, but it is the one
  lie this terminal cannot fully refuse without breaking interactive editing.

- PASTE is sanitized the same way before it reaches the shell, so invisible or
  bidi characters copied from a web page never enter your command line.

- INPUT forwards printable characters and the control keys, each sent as its
  control byte exactly as a real terminal does (Ctrl+C -> 0x03, Ctrl+\\ -> 0x1c,
  readline's Ctrl+A/R/U ...): a cooked shell's line discipline turns 0x03 into
  SIGINT, while a raw-mode program reads the byte itself (so an app's own "press
  Ctrl+C again to exit" works). Still one-directional. terminate_foreground() is
  the guaranteed panic button (SIGTERM then SIGKILL) for a program that ignores
  all of the above. An opt-in command hook (apply_hook) can additionally judge a
  typed line before Enter submits it.

This is a deliberately minimal, line-oriented terminal by default: no escape
parser at all -- every escape sequence in the output is stripped in the renderer
(safety does not rest on TERM, which is a normal xterm-256color, but on that
unconditional stripping). An opt-in TUI mode (apply_tui) instead interprets
escapes through a pyte screen model so full-screen programs (ssh, vim, htop,
tmux) work; mode is only a rendering choice over the same byte stream, so it
switches without restarting the shell and a running program survives the switch.
Even in TUI mode every cell is still character-filtered and pyte only builds a
screen model, so program output cannot drive it to set the title or touch the
clipboard the way a real terminal's escape handling can (the programs you run
still have your normal user access). The window flags TUI mode with a visible
risk indicator; the strict line mode remains the safe-by-construction default.
