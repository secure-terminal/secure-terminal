"""
Pure, Qt-free sanitization core for secure-terminal.

Everything here is a plain function on strings/bytes with no GUI dependency, so
it runs identically under the terminal widget and under a bare Python test
(dist-ai), the way output-lies keeps its analyzer DOM-free. It decides what is
safe to display and names the class of anything that is not; the widget layer
(terminal.py) adds only the interactive cursor handling and, optionally, colour.
