"""Drop-in settings, the systemd .d way.

Settings are KEY=value plain text spread over *.conf files in drop-in
directories, so a distro or an admin can seed defaults and the user can override
them:

    /etc/secure-terminal.d/*.conf              (distro / system seed, lowest)
    /usr/local/etc/secure-terminal.d/*.conf    (local admin)
    ~/.config/secure-terminal.d/*.conf         (user, highest)

Only files ending in .conf are read. Within each directory files are applied in
lexical order of filename (so 10-*.conf before 90-*.conf), and the directories
are applied lowest to highest, so a later KEY overrides an earlier one and the
user always wins over a system seed. The application writes its own settings to a
mid-numbered user file (50_user.conf): it beats the system seeds, and a user can
still drop a higher-numbered .conf to override even the app's own choices.

Hardening / corporate lockdown: a PRIVILEGED directory (/etc, /usr/local/etc)
may declare `lock=key1,key2,...`. A locked key is enforced from the system layer
and the user config CANNOT override it -- such an attempt is ignored and reported
in Config.violations, and the application greys out the matching control. `lock`
is honored only from the privileged directories; a user config can neither lock
nor unlock. load() returns a Config (a dict plus .locked and .violations).

Loading is fully defensive: a missing/unreadable file, a malformed line or an
unknown key never raises and never crashes; the value falls back to its default.
Only these drop-in .conf files are read -- there is no legacy single-file config.
