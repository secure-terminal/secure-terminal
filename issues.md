# Known issues and design limitations

Open trade-offs in the current design. Not bugs with a clear fix; each needs a
decision.

## 1. Partial input line + the CLI/TUI re-export

Switching a tab between CLI and TUI mode re-exports `TERM` into the running shell
by writing `export TERM=...\r` at the prompt (so the shell re-reads terminfo
without a restart). If you have a **partially typed command** at the prompt and
then toggle mode, the re-export is appended to that line and the `\r` submits the
combined text.

- Impact: usually a harmless `command not found` on the mangled line, not a
  dangerous command. There is no reliable, shell-agnostic way to detect or
  preserve a partial input line from outside the shell.
- The switch IS already refused while a foreground program owns the terminal, and
  the re-export is skipped for `-- PROGRAM` tabs (only the default login shell
  gets it) -- so this is specifically the bare-prompt, mid-typing case.
- Options:
  - (a) Prefix the re-export with a line-clear (`Ctrl-A Ctrl-K`): safe, but
    discards whatever you had typed.
  - (b) Drop the auto-submit: switch rendering only, and let `TERM` update on the
    next command the shell runs.
  - (c) Accept it as a rare edge (current behaviour).

## 2. `TERM=secure-terminal` breaks curses apps over ssh

In CLI mode a tab advertises `TERM=secure-terminal`. `ssh` forwards `TERM` to the
remote host, which does not have this custom terminfo entry, so a remote
curses/readline program reports `unknown terminal` and degrades. Installing the
entry in the LOCAL system terminfo db does not help remote hosts.

- Design expectation: use **TUI mode** for ssh -- it advertises `xterm-256color`,
  which every host has.
- This is the concrete downside of keeping the custom entry instead of the
  standard `dumb`. `dumb` is in every base terminfo db (resolves over ssh) and is
  fingerprint-neutral, but drops all colour and in-line editing. See the
  compatibility page's terminfo comparison.
- Worth reconsidering `dumb` for CLI mode if ssh-in-CLI is a common workflow.
