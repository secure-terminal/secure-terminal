# secure-terminal

A terminal where paste is safe by construction.

Paste a command copied from the web, or read text a program printed, without
worrying about invisible characters, bidi overrides or escape sequences.
secure-terminal accepts and displays plain printable ASCII by default and nothing
else, so a pasted or printed lie has nothing to hide in.

This is the problem [output lies](https://output-lies.github.io) documents,
removed at the source.

## Threat model (what this does, and does not, protect)

secure-terminal does **not** sandbox the programs you run. If you choose to run
something harmful, it runs, exactly as in any terminal; nothing at the terminal
layer can change that.

What it guards is **viewing untrusted data**. The danger in a normal terminal is
that bytes you did not author, and did not choose to execute, can *act* rather than
merely *display*: a crafted file you open, a program's output, an SSH login banner,
a filename in a listing or a commit message can carry escape sequences. On a normal
terminal, merely reading such output can quietly change your clipboard (so a later
paste inserts text you never copied), draw a link whose visible text lies about its
destination, put text onto your input line, or paint text invisibly. A passive,
low-suspicion action causes a side-effect you never intended, without you running
anything.

secure-terminal removes those escapes so that reading untrusted output is safe, and
sanitizes paste so untrusted text cannot smuggle a hidden command into your shell.
It does nothing about the programs you deliberately run.

## How it stays safe

- **ASCII-only display.** Program output is passed through a sanitizer: ANSI/OSC
  escape sequences are removed and every byte that is not printable ASCII (plus
  tab and newline) is dropped, the way `stcat` does for logs. A hostile filename,
  a forged status line or a Trojan-Source comment cannot redraw or reorder what
  you read.
- **No escape-sequence interpretation.** There is no ANSI parser to attack. The
  terminal advertises `TERM=dumb` and honors no cursor moves, colors, alternate
  screens or OSC hyperlinks from the child process.
- **Sanitized paste, with a review.** Pasted text is stripped to printable
  ASCII before it reaches the shell, so invisible or bidi characters never enter
  your command line. When a paste actually contains unicode or control
  characters, a review bar opens inside the window, holds the paste, and shows
  it four ways side by side: the original as it looks, a
  Detail rendering that names every hidden character inline, and exactly what
  each send button would deliver (stripped to ASCII, or with printable unicode
  kept). The panes are rendered by the terminal's own pipeline, so each hidden
  character wears its risk-class colour and stays click-to-inspect. While the
  paste is held, terminal input is suspended and both send buttons are
  countdown-gated (configurable; Enter or Esc rejects), so a stray key cannot
  wave a hostile paste through. A plain-ASCII paste is not interrupted.
- **Tiny input allowlist.** You type printable ASCII plus a small set of control
  keys that the pseudo-terminal turns into signals:

  | Key | Signal |
  |---|---|
  | `Ctrl+C` | `SIGINT` |
  | `Ctrl+Z` | `SIGTSTP` |
  | `Ctrl+\` | `SIGQUIT` |
  | `Ctrl+D` | EOF |

  We only write the control byte; the kernel line discipline does the rest.
  Backspace is honored so you can rub out a typo; it erases one character and
  never crosses a line, so it cannot rewrite earlier output.

## Everyday comforts

The safety model above does not cost you the usual conveniences:

- **Tabs.** Each tab is its own shell over its own pseudo-terminal. Open with
  `Ctrl+Shift+T`, close with `Ctrl+Shift+W`; closing a shell closes its tab.
- **Copy and paste.** Toolbar buttons and `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Shift+V`
  (plain `Ctrl+C` stays `SIGINT`). Paste is still sanitized before it reaches
  the shell.
- **Text zoom.** `Ctrl+wheel`, `Ctrl+plus` / `Ctrl+minus`, or the percentage box
  in the top right (Up/Down keys or type a value). `Ctrl+0` resets to 100%.
- **Themes.** White-on-black and black-on-white, under **View -> Theme**. Plain,
  high-contrast, no syntax coloring.
- **Unicode display mode** (top bar, per tab, default **Box**). Box replaces every
  non-ASCII character with a coloured box, one per character, tinted by risk class
  (a bidi override, a zero-width character and a plain foreign letter get different
  colours); safe, lossy, and hard to miss. A saved transcript maps the box back to
  a plain ASCII `_`. Show renders legitimate unicode as glyphs so you can read a
  log, but still tints each one by risk class -- a homoglyph confusable with ASCII
  wears a louder colour than honest foreign text, and the invisible, bidi and
  control classes (which have no visible glyph) still show as a coloured placeholder.
  Reveal shows every non-ASCII character as a `<U+XXXX>` badge to inspect exactly
  what is there. Escapes are stripped in every mode.
- **Save transcript** (File menu, `Ctrl+Shift+S`). Writes the current tab's
  scrollback to a file. Because the buffer is already sanitized plain ASCII, the
  saved file is safe to open anywhere, unlike a normal terminal's raw log.
- **Scrollback length** (View menu): 1,000 / 10,000 / 100,000 lines or Unlimited
  (default). Held in memory while running.
- **Session restore** (File menu, on by default). On exit the open tabs -- their
  names, colours, per-tab settings and scrollback -- are saved to
  `~/.local/state/secure-terminal/session.json` and restored next launch, with a
  fresh shell under the restored history. The running programs are not
  resurrected. Turn it off, or clear the saved session, from the File menu; when
  off, nothing is written. An unlimited tab's saved scrollback is capped so the
  file cannot grow without bound.
- **Persistent settings** in systemd-style drop-in directories. Settings are
  KEY=value `.conf` files read, lowest precedence first, from
  `/etc/secure-terminal.d/`, `/usr/local/etc/secure-terminal.d/` and
  `~/.config/secure-terminal.d/` -- so a distro or admin can seed defaults and
  the user overrides them. Only `*.conf` files are read; within a directory they
  apply in lexical order, later winning. The app writes its own settings to
  `~/.config/secure-terminal.d/50_user.conf` (a higher-numbered `.conf` you drop
  in wins over it). **Settings -> Folders & Files...**
  shows every location with Copy and Open buttons.
- **Tabs you can name and colour.** Double-click a tab to rename it; right-click
  for rename, a colour, or close. Handy when several tabs each run a different
  TUI. A user name and a program-set title are kept separately (your name wins as
  the label; the program title shows in the tooltip).
- **Run a specific program** (File -> New Tab Running..., `Ctrl+Shift+R`). Opens
  a tab straight into `ssh host`, `tmux`, `claude`, etc. instead of the login
  shell. A plain new tab (`Ctrl+Shift+T`) still runs `$SHELL`.
- **Optional title / notifications** (View menu, per tab, default off). When on,
  and only in TUI mode, a program may set the tab title (OSC 0/2) and send
  notifications (OSC 9), both sanitized to plain ASCII first. Clipboard-write
  (OSC 52) and hyperlink (OSC 8) escapes stay blocked either way.
- **Menu bar** for the same actions, discoverable rather than memorized.

## TUI mode (opt-in, run full-screen programs)

The strict line mode above cannot run curses apps, because they are driven
entirely by the escape sequences it refuses to parse. **TUI mode** (top bar and
**View -> TUI mode**, per tab, default off, needs `python3-pyte`) relaxes that so
you can run `ssh`, an editor, `htop`, the Claude Code CLI, and use the shell's own
completion menus and progress displays. A yellow indicator and a hover tooltip
flag it while it is active, because it is a deliberate, lower-guarantee mode:

- Escapes are interpreted, but inside an isolated in-memory screen model (`pyte`)
  that has no OS reach: it **cannot set the window title or touch the system
  clipboard**, so those spoofing/exfil vectors stay closed.
- Every character placed on the screen is **still ASCII/unicode-filtered**, so a
  program can position and colour text but cannot smuggle an invisible, bidi or
  homoglyph character into what you read.
- Colours use the same contrast guard, so nothing can be painted invisibly.

TUI mode renders through the confined screen model at all times (with its own
scrollback), so a program that positions the cursor renders faithfully: a
completion menu, a progress bar, or a full-screen program on the alternate screen
(which is snapshotted and restored so it never disturbs your scrollback).

What you give up: because the cursor can be positioned, a program can draw a
*misleading interface* (a fake prompt, say) or overwrite a line you already read,
so only run programs you trust. This is "restricted-emulator safe," not "safe by
construction."

**Security comparison with the default mode.** The line (CLI) mode, and
everything the project's guarantees rest on, is **unchanged**: it never interprets
an escape, the confined screen model is **never fed** in CLI mode, and output is
append-only, so a program can never reach back and rewrite a line you have already
seen (transcript integrity). TUI mode is the one place escapes are interpreted;
the only change from earlier versions is that it now does so **uniformly** (at a
shell prompt too, not only while a full-screen program holds the alternate
screen). No new class of side-effect is enabled -- title, clipboard (OSC 52) and
hyperlink escapes remain neutralized in both modes -- and every on-screen cell is
still filtered. The extension is contained entirely within the opt-in, clearly
indicated TUI mode.

## What it does not do (on purpose)

- **No non-ASCII by default.** Additional character sets may become opt-in much
  later, always as an explicit allowlist, never a general decoder.
- **No terminal side-effects.** No window-title control, no clipboard escape
  (OSC 52), no hyperlink escapes, in either mode.

The default is a deliberately minimal, line-oriented display. Backspace works, but
because line mode neutralizes the escapes readline uses to redraw, richer in-line
editing (mid-line cursor movement, history recall, completion menus) is
intentionally basic there; compose or paste a line, read the exact bytes, then run
it. Turn on TUI mode when you want those interactive features to render.
