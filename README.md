# secure-terminal

A terminal where paste is safe by construction.

Paste a command copied from the web, or read text a program printed, without
worrying about invisible characters, bidi overrides or escape sequences.
secure-terminal accepts and displays plain printable ASCII by default and nothing
else, so a pasted or printed lie has nothing to hide in.

This is the problem [output lies](https://output-lies.github.io) documents,
removed at the source.

## How it stays safe

- **ASCII-only display.** Program output is passed through a sanitizer: ANSI/OSC
  escape sequences are removed and every byte that is not printable ASCII (plus
  tab and newline) is dropped, the way `stcat` does for logs. A hostile filename,
  a forged status line or a Trojan-Source comment cannot redraw or reorder what
  you read.
- **No escape-sequence interpretation.** There is no ANSI parser to attack. The
  terminal advertises `TERM=dumb` and honors no cursor moves, colors, alternate
  screens or OSC hyperlinks from the child process.
- **Sanitized paste.** Pasted text is stripped to printable ASCII before it
  reaches the shell, so invisible or bidi characters never enter your command
  line.
- **Tiny input allowlist.** You type printable ASCII plus a small set of control
  keys that the pseudo-terminal turns into signals:

  | Key | Signal |
  |---|---|
  | `Ctrl+C` | `SIGINT` |
  | `Ctrl+Z` | `SIGTSTP` |
  | `Ctrl+\` | `SIGQUIT` |
  | `Ctrl+D` | EOF |

  We only write the control byte; the kernel line discipline does the rest.
  Backspace is honored so you can rub out a typo; it erases one character and
  never crosses a line, so it cannot rewrite earlier output.

## Everyday comforts

The safety model above does not cost you the usual conveniences:

- **Tabs.** Each tab is its own shell over its own pseudo-terminal. Open with
  `Ctrl+Shift+T`, close with `Ctrl+Shift+W`; closing a shell closes its tab.
- **Copy and paste.** Toolbar buttons and `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Shift+V`
  (plain `Ctrl+C` stays `SIGINT`). Paste is still sanitized before it reaches
  the shell.
- **Text zoom.** `Ctrl+wheel`, `Ctrl+plus` / `Ctrl+minus`, or the percentage box
  in the top right (Up/Down keys or type a value). `Ctrl+0` resets to 100%.
- **Themes.** White-on-black and black-on-white, under **View -> Theme**. Plain,
  high-contrast, no syntax coloring.
- **Menu bar** for the same actions, discoverable rather than memorized.

## What it does not do (on purpose)

- **No full-screen TUIs** (nano, vim, emacs, htop). Curses apps are driven
  entirely by control and escape sequences, exactly what this terminal refuses
  to parse. Run those in a normal terminal you already treat as untrusted.
- **No non-ASCII by default.** Additional character sets may become opt-in much
  later, always as an explicit allowlist, never a general decoder.

This is a deliberately minimal, line-oriented first version. Backspace works, but
because the display neutralizes the escapes readline uses to redraw, richer
in-line editing (mid-line cursor movement, history recall) is intentionally
basic; compose or paste a line, read the exact bytes, then run it.
